---

## 6. Technical Notes

- **Editor:** Flutter `EditableText` for raw performance.
- **Markdown Rendering:** `flutter_markdown` or custom renderer for preview.
- **Code Highlighting:** `highlight.dart` for code syntax.
- **Storage:** Hive for MVP, abstracted storage layer for future cloud sync.
- **State Management:** GetX.

---

## 7. MVP Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation
- **Dependencies:** Install and configure core packages:
  - `get`: For state management and navigation.
  - `hive` & `hive_flutter`: For local database.
  - `path_provider`: To find the correct local path for Hive.
- **Architecture:**
  - Set up the GetX folder structure (`controllers`, `views`, `models`, `bindings`).
  - Create a `Note` model.
  - Implement base routing and navigation.
- **UI Shell:**
  - Build the main app layout (e.g., a home screen with a note list and a floating action button to create a new note).
  - Implement theme switching for light and dark modes.

### Phase 2: Core Editor & Storage
- **Database:**
  - Initialize Hive and register the `Note` adapter.
  - Create a `DatabaseService` to handle all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Editor Screen:**
  - Build the note editor view using a `TextField` or `EditableText` widget.
  - Connect the editor to a GetX controller to manage its state (`TextEditingController`).
  - Implement logic to save notes to Hive automatically (debounced) or manually.
- **Note List:**
  - Create a view to display all saved notes from Hive.
  - Allow users to tap a note to open it in the editor.
  - Implement swipe-to-delete functionality.

### Phase 3: Markdown & Export
- **Markdown Preview:**
  - Integrate the `flutter_markdown` package.
  - Add a toggle button on the editor screen to switch between the raw text editor and a read-only markdown preview.
- **Export:**
  - Implement "Export to `.md`" functionality.
  - Implement "Export to `.txt`" functionality.
  - Use the `share_plus` package to bring up the native share sheet.

### Phase 4: Search & Organization
- **Tagging:**
  - Add a `List<String> tags` field to the `Note` model.
  - Create UI in the editor to add/remove tags for a note.
  - Update the home screen to allow filtering notes by tag.
- **Search:**
  - Add a search bar to the note list screen.
  - Implement a search controller and logic to filter notes by title and content in real-time.

### Phase 5: Refinement & Performance Tuning
- **Performance:**
  - Profile the editor's input latency.
  - Benchmark markdown rendering and search speeds against the success metrics.
  - Optimize database queries and UI rendering.
- **Polish:**
  - Refine UI/UX based on initial testing.
  - Ensure a smooth and intuitive user flow.
  - Fix any outstanding bugs.
